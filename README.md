# ðŸš€ DSA Practice in C++

Welcome to my **DSA learning repository**!  
Iâ€™m pursuing B.Tech CSE and documenting my journey in **Data Structures & Algorithms** using C++.  

This repo contains all the problems I practice daily, organized by topic/day.

## ðŸ“… Progress Tracker

### âœ… Day 1 â€“ Basics
- Topics: Input/Output, Data Types, Loops, If-Else, Functions  
- Learned how to take user input, use different data types, write conditions, and create simple functions.  

### âœ… Day 2 â€“ Basic Maths
- Problems solved:  
  - Count digits in a number  
  - Reverse a number  
  - Palindrome number check  
  - Armstrong number check  
  - Print divisors of a number  
  - Prime number check  
  - GCD / HCF of two numbers  
- Key Learning: `%` and `/` operators are powerful for solving math-based problems.  

### âœ… Day 3 â€“ Recursion
- Problems solved using recursion:  
  - Print name N times  
  - Print numbers from 1 â†’ N  
  - Print numbers from N â†’ 1  
  - Sum of first N numbers  
  - Factorial of a number  
  - Reverse a vector/array  
  - Palindrome check  
  - Fibonacci numbers  
- Key Learning: Recursion works best when the **base case** and **recursive step** are clear.

### Day 4 - Hashing
- problems solved using hashing:
  - hashing theory
  - count frequency
  - lowest / highest frequency
- Key Learning: Hashing reduces recheck and can be very useful for repeating dig data.

### Day 5 - Sorting
- sorting algorithms
  - selection sort
  - bubble sort
  - insertion sort
  - merge sort
  - quick sort
- Key Learning: first three algorithms are important for understanding the core logic behind sorting and other algo's are for better efficiency

### Day 6 - Arrays
- basic problems
  - largest element
  - second largest element
  - check if array is sorted
  - remove duplicates for the array (sorted/ unsorted)
- Key Learning: arrays are the most important data types i have came accross so far, and these simple problems are easy but imporant
  
### Day 7 - Rotate an Array
- rotate by 1 place and D places
  - brute force O(n-d)
  - better approach O(n)
  - optimal approach O(n) , space O(1)
- Key Learning: brute forces are easy to understand and write but there are much better ways for solving the problem.

## âœ¨ Reflections
- **Day 1**: Functions make code reusable and reduce repetition.  
- **Day 2**: Math problems become easy once you break them down into smaller operations.  
- **Day 3**: Recursion is powerful but needs careful handling of base cases to avoid infinite loops.
- **Day 4**: hashing can used to store frequencies, which can be used to compare the data and derive conclusions.
- **Day 5**: time and space complexity are important to understand as we write codes. it helps in better efficiency and fast output
- **Day 6**: using pointer are better than creating other arrays.
- **Day 7**: there alwasy exist a better soluiton just have to try harder.
